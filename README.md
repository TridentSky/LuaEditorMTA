Hey MTA community! I'm releasing a complete Lua code editor that runs directly inside MTA:SA. Edit your server scripts in real-time without leaving the game or dealing with FTP uploads.

This is a full development environment with professional features, not just a basic text editor. I've been using it for months and it's completely changed how I develop servers.

Key Features:

CodeMirror syntax highlighting (Visual Studio Code quality)
Word wrap support for clean code viewing
Real-time file editing and saving
Resource browser with search functionality
Multi-language interface (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Turkish)
Dark professional theme
Whitelist/Blacklist security system
Admin ACL permission controls
Completely offline (no external dependencies)
Instant server updates without restarts
- To open the editor, use the command /editor.
What it does: Browse all your server resources, view client/server files, and modify code with proper syntax highlighting. Changes save directly to your server files instantly.

Requirements:

Admin ACL permissions (configure your admin group)
Set up whitelist/blacklist for resource access control
Why I'm sharing this: I believe in giving back to the MTA community. This tool has saved me countless hours of development time, and I want everyone to benefit from it.

This is just the first of many free tools I plan to release. The MTA community has always been about helping each other build better servers.

Download it, try it out, and let me know what you think. More contributions coming soon.
